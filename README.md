## _Description_
This is business logic to be used to make a web application that will take a users inputted age and average life expectancy and provide comparisons to Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter's solar years and what life expectancy would be on respective planets. A sample web application is provided in "Index.html"

This is a practice project for practicing TDD, jest, npm, ES6 features such as classes and template literals, and webpacks for a class at Epicodus.
